# Treap vs Dynamic Array
This repository contains code for assignment 1 of Advanced Algorithsm and Data Structures COMP90077 (University of Melbourne). It explores the nature of insertion, deletion, and search operations for the Treap and Dynamic Array data structures. The experimentation was conducted by running several experiments with varied size of operation sequences and varied probabilitiesof distinct operations occurring in the operation. The runtimes of each of these experiments with the different variations were recorded and plotted for analysis in the attached report.
